Fist Project for EGR-103


Hello there. My name is Kaushal Chaudhary. I previously attended UK and completed my Bachelors of Economics but after finding my passion in computer technology, I decided to come back and get an Engineering degree. I am 28 years old and hope to one day work for a Fortune 500 company as a Software Engineer and eventually create my own business with my own software of some sort. I am interested in Machine/Deep learning and A.I. advancements. I hope one day to use my knowledge of Deep learning and apply it to everyday appliances.
